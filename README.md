# xLightsDesigner

Repository for the **xLights Agent Sequencer** initiative.

## Structure

### `docs/`
Cross-project and project-scoped documentation.
- `docs/architecture/`: architecture decisions and analysis for the overall initiative.
- `docs/projects/`: project-specific docs and proposal artifacts.

### `specs/`
Implementation-facing specifications.
- `specs/projects/`: executable project specs and implementation plans.

## Current Project Phases

### `audio-timing-lyrics` (Phase 1)
Goal: automate song prep workflows in xLights:
- audio timing track generation,
- song structure track generation (verse/chorus/etc.),
- lyric track generation/import.

Project assets:
- Docs: `docs/projects/audio-timing-lyrics/`
- Specs: `specs/projects/audio-timing-lyrics/`

## Notes
This repo is intentionally organized as:
- one top-level initiative (agent sequencer),
- multiple scoped projects/phases underneath.
